# React Filemanager

Hello ex [angular-filemanager](https://github.com/joni2back/angular-filemanager/) user, this is the new version in React.

I will try to make it clean and retro-compatible with the previous bridges/connectors

It's very important for me your collaboration on my development tasks and time. 
Please help me to move forward with a donation by paypal :) [![Donate](https://www.paypal.com/en_GB/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=XRB7EW72PS982)
